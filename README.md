# Embryo Predation and Parental Care on *Nocomis* Nests
## *Mr. Mom:* Nocomis *embryo-burying effectively increases embryo survival amidst predation by all mutualism participants*

The following repository contains all data, codes, and information related to a study conducted by the Frimpong Lab at Virginia Tech, which investigated the role of *Nocomis* parental care (through the act of embryo burying) and how the threat of predation changes across the landscape of *Nocomis* nests. Additionally, this study investigated the role the *Nocomis* host and its associates play as embryo predators using DNA metabarcoding. Data for this study were collected from Toms Creek, near Blacksburg, VA, USA, from 2021-2023. As of October, 2025, the full study has now been accepted for publication at *Ecology of Freshwater Fish*.

## Background

Many species of the North American freshwater family Leuciscidae participate in a mode of reproduction called “nest association,” where multiple other species (“nest associates”) spawn in the nest of a “host” species. Nest association is generally considered to be a mutualistic interaction. Among leuciscids, perhaps best-known for utilizing this strategy are the pebble-nest building chubs of the genus Nocomis (henceforth: “chubs”). Using their mouths, adult male chubs build large, mounded nests out of streambed pebbles, which attract other minnows as nest associates due to the protection from embryo predators that the nest, and the parental care behaviors of the chub, offers. We investigated how predation risk was distributed across the nest, and the role of chub and associate as nest predators.

We addressed four objectives in this study: 
  1) examine the effectiveness of the host’s embryo-burying parental care behaviors as protection against embryo predation along a vertical gradient of the nest by comparing predation rates between buried and unburied embryos
  2) similarly examine how predation rates change along an upstream-downstream (horizontal) nest gradient
  3) determine whether the host, female chub, and/or associates contribute to embryo predation risk by preying upon each other’s embryos while aggregating on a nest
  4) assess the effect of nest associate density on the survival rate of unburied embryos as a test of the effect of nest associate abundance representing embryo predation pressure 

We hypothesized that buried embryos experience less predation pressure than unburied embryos and that the host’s overt moving of stones onto and within the nest is an effective mechanism for shifting the demersal embryos of leuciscids deeper into the nest. We also hypothesized that both the host and nest associates actively participate in embryo predation, and that this predation increases with increasing nest associate abundance. 

## Methods

We conducted three experiments to meet our objectives. 

For Experiments A and C, we conducted experiments whereby we placed pouches of egg bait in different vertical and horizontal positions on nests, and collected data including egg survival rate after one hour and the number of nest associates attending the nest. These data were then analyzed to find any pattern of predation risk, either following a vertical or horizontal gradient, or responding to nest associate abundance. 

For Experiment B, we collected and sacrificed spawning chubs and associates, collected their stomach contents, and then analyzed the contents using DNA metabarcoding.

## Results

Experiment A: Embryo burying was found to have a significant effect on embryo survival, with buried pouches having a signficantly greater survival rate. The greatest difference in survival rate between buried and unburied pouches was seen along the downstream side of the nest. 

Experiment B: Both chubs and associates were found to have consumed embryonic matter, indicating that predation from host and associates does occur on chub nests. 

Experiment C: Associate abundance was found to have an effect, albeit weak, on embryo survival rate.
